        <p>Despite having created a functioning model for Microbot movement, our model is not perfect and is limited in several respects. Firstly, by condensing all possible coefficients and variables that affect the movement of a Microbot, it significantly reduces the versatility and applicability of our model. Because of this, our model is primarily suited to linear movements and some angular movements. If our group had more time, we would have attempted to integrate several other parameters into our model, such as rotational velocity, friction, resistance, and the medium through which a microbot moves. We would have also made sliders for these parameters too so that we could visualize their effects on the movement of a Microbot.</p>
        <p>Secondly, our model was made with a small dataset that only involved the linear movement of a microbot. If we had more time, we would have collected more videos of Microbots moving in more complicated patterns, in a circle for example, and under different conditions. These conditions might include movement through more viscous fluids or exposure to two different magnetic fields acting on the Microbot simultaneously.</p>
        <p>Lastly, if we had more time for this project, we would have ideally done some simulations where we used completely random values for the logistic model and then exposed an actual Microbot to these conditions afterward to see how accurate our model’s prediction was. This would have allowed us to have another means of validating our model’s accuracy outside of replicating the results of known Microbot trajectories.</p>
