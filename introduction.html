        <h1>Modeling Superparamagnetic Micro-Robots for Non-Invasive Surgical Procedures</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            According to the National Library of Medicine, there have been approximately 314 acute myocardial infarctions or 
            heart attacks per 100,000 hospitalizations in the United States since 2001. On top of this, the Centers for Disease 
            Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that more than 765,000 people in the United States are victims of strokes 
            every year. At the root of both of these pathological phenomena is the formation of life-threatening circulatory 
            thromboses, which generate dense fibrin clots that occlude the body’s capacity to efficiently and effectively 
            transport oxygenated blood to its vital organs. The solution our group poses to diminish this problem are 
            MicroBots, a cutting-edge technological approach that implements micro-scale colloidal particles that can be 
            actuated using an external magnetic field to drive to the site of an internal blood clot and lyse the heart 
            attack or stroke before it can fully develop in the body! This biological and biomedical problem carries both 
            intellectual and social merit, providing scientists and physicians a pipeline for future research on the use of 
            microscopic materials within the tortuous environments of the human body system. Also, this biological problem 
            is pertinent to populations such as that of the African American community, who are more hereditarily predisposed 
            to clot-causing diseases such as sickle cell disease according to the American Society of Hematology. Therefore, 
            in order to prevent health complications related to the formation of thrombosis and advance the development of 
            biomedical tools for minimally-invasive procedures, the MicroBot is the optimal choice.  [add citations]

            Consequently, we plan to approach this biological problem by implementing multiple BIOL300 and BIOL301 concepts 
            within our project portfolio. In the initial phase of the project, we will collect videos in TIF format of a 
            MicroBot translating in a straight line across a microscopic gasket. Using the contrast within the photo, we 
            will perform image analysis on the frames of the video by thresholding and median filtering each image to locate 
            the bot and track its motion to model a differential equation for the bot’s velocity. The “skimage” python module
            will be the primary image analysis tool, and the resultant velocity model will then be plotted to generate 
            interactive graphs with the “holoviews” and “bokeh” modules. In the final phase of the project, the image analysis 
            code will be paired with the parametrized velocity equation to generate graphs with sliders containing both the 
            actual and projected/predicted trajectories of the MicroBot. By changing the sliders, the varying paths of the 
            MicroBot can be visualized under differing conditions associated with the velocity equation. In theory, this will 
            provide physicians or scientists a tool they can use to visualize the path of a MicroBot within the human 
            circulatory system to plan out their approach for the surgical removal of a blood clot.
